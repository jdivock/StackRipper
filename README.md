# StackRipper

I could run network inspector every week and download stuff from
soundcloud by hand. Or I could just write this script.

## TODO

- Add id3 tags
- Add tests
- wonder how far I can take that, job to ping hypem and ensure data
  format is still how I expect it?
- Make async stuff less painful, maybe pull in Jafar's stuff
