# StackRipper

I could run network inspector every week and download stuff from
soundcloud by hand. Or I could just write this script.

## OH NOES It's busted

I guess whatever loophole I was sneaking in they closed up, I'll try to refigure this out later

## TODO

- Add id3 tags
- Add tests
- wonder how far I can take that, job to ping hypem and ensure data
  format is still how I expect it?
- Make async stuff less painful, maybe pull in Jafar's stuff
