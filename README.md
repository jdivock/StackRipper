# StackRipper

I could run network inspector every week and download stuff from
soundcloud by hand. Or I could just write this script.

## TODO

- Add id3 tags
- Make async stuff less painful, maybe pull in Jafar's stuff
- Patch cases where it dies on certain urls/providers
- Make more resilient, right now if one song dies the whole thing dies
